## Scaffolding

The app has been scaffolded with the CRA (create-react-app) for speed and ability to transpile code into webpack-babel transpilers.

 ## Branching

 - Separate branches have been created for each task to chunk-debug code and push clean code into the repo.

 **Branch 1: user-login** Estimated time 8-hours (one-day) Fibonnaci complexity 3
  - Sets up folder structure for separation of concerns and modularisation of the page-ui
  - Sets up initial tests to ensure all components render correctly ```npm run test```
  - Sets up components based on passing tests ```App.js```, ```Button.js``` and ```AuthLoginForm```
  - Sets up a basic logic-free components and vanilla css based on the wireframe
  - Checks set up ```npm run start``` working in FE server
