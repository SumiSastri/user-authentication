## Scaffolding

The app has been scaffolded with the CRA (create-react-app) for speed and ability to transpile code into webpack-babel transpilers.

## Testing frameworks

- Jest and Enzyme

 ## State management strategy & assumptions
 
The key assumption made was to use redux as a state management tool as the brief requested  a type with the payload   ``` "type": "USER_PASSWORD_AUTH"``` 

## Branching strategy and challenges
Four branches were set-up and refactored (the detail is in src/docs/branch-history). In brief the branches user-login was set up and refactored in the branch redux-set-up to navigate between pages front-end-routes branch was set up and finally the policy-page branch to deal with the final step of the challenge.

Key challenge was unscrambling the auth code headers. Working to debug the 304 error from the response in network call and fix. 


## Time blocks and complexity

8 days of work has gone into this task. Fibonacci complexity of tasks varied in a range between 1 & 13 with most tasks between 1 & 5.

Each of the branches has an estimate of the time spent with the Fibonnaci complexity level.
